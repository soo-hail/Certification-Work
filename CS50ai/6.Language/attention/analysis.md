# Analysis

## Layer A, Head B - Relationship between Preposition and Nouns.

I Observed that attention in this head focuses on the relationship between prepositions and the nouns.

Example Sentences:
- The book is on the table.
- The cat is hiding under the chair

In both sentenses, attention focuses on Prepositions('on' and 'under').

## Layer X, Head Y - Relationship between Determiners and Nouns

I Observed that attention in this head focuses on the relationship between determiners and the nouns.

Example Sentences:
- The dog barks all day long.
- A quick brown fox jumps over the lazy dog.

In both sentenses, attention focuses on determiners('The' and 'A') and their associated nouns('dog', 'fox'). This shows that this head might be responsible for understanding structure between determiners and nouns.
